## How to run this project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= v14
- Truffle and Ganache
- Yarn
- `git checkout master`

### Contracts

- Run `yarn install` in project root ( back file ) to install Truffle build and smart contract dependencies
- Run local testnet in port `7545` with an Ethereum client, e.g. Ganache
- `truffle migrate --network development`
- `truffle console --network development`
- Run tests in Truffle console: `test`
- `development` network id is 1337, remember to change it in Metamask as well!

### Frontend

- `cd client`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- Open `http://localhost:3000`

### How to populate locally deployed contract with listings

- `truffle migrate --network development`
- `truffle console --network development`

- dont know what is this below : 
- `let rr = await Rentals.deployed()`
- Add two listings:
- `rr.addProperty(web3.utils.toWei("0.00156"), "HÃ¤meentie 77", "Duplex with a nice view", "https://google.com","https://www.hermannikuvia.fi/wp-content/uploads/Hameentie-77-sisapiha.jpg")`
- `rr.addProperty(web3.utils.toWei("0.002"), "Mannerheimintie 30 A", "Duplex with a really bad view", "https://google.com","https://www.finna.fi/Cover/Show?id=hkm.HKMS000005%3Akm002zsb&index=0&size=large&source=Solr")`
- Send ETH to local wallet: `web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: "<your local address>", to: "<your local network wallet>", value: web3.utils.toWei("10") })`
- *********
- `cd client && yarn start`
- Open local ui from `http://localhost:3000`
- Make sure your Metamask localhost network is in port `8545` and chain id is `1337`.
- If you get `TXRejectedError` when sending a transaction, reset your Metamask account from Advanced settings.
